**Segra** is a powerful recording software built on Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), designed for gamers and content creators. Record, clip, and (soon) upload gameplay highlights effortlessly, with smart automation and deep game integration.

## ✨ Features
- **Auto-Start Recording**: Begin recording automatically when your game launches.
- **Instant Clipping**: Save key moments with a hotkey.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built on OBS for high performance and low resource usage.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust recording quality, hotkeys, and storage paths.

## 🚧 Coming Soon

- **Game Integration** Track in-game stats like kills, deaths, and assists to auto-generate highlights.

## Why "Segra"?
**Segra** (pronounced *"say-grah"*) means **"to win"** in Swedish. We built Segra to help you **preserve those moments**: the chaotic fun with friends, the clutch plays, and the wins (*segra!*) that deserve their own highlight reel.
